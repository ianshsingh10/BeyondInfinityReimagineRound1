What is Re-Imagine? <br>
Re-Imagine is a web design contest by The Sheryians
Coding School. It's all about giving Indian/International
brand websites a modern makeover. Unlike other contests,
they focus on making bold, fresh designs for real brands. They
want students to learn by doing, with real-world examples

Competition Details:
Create two complete single-page websites for any two brands, ensuring
that you reimagine the theme and overall look and feel of each site
rather than cloning existing designs. Upload both websites to GitHub
and obtain the GitHub Pages links.
